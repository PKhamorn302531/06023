> **Please note:** AdGuard is not an antivirus program. It can warn you when you're going to visit a malware or phishing website, but **it does not remove viruses from your device.**

If you suspect your computer is infected by malware or viruses, first of all you can inspect your computer with utilities from leading antiviruses.

**Free antivirus utilities**

There are many of them and you can use any one you prefer, here is simply a couple examples:

[Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool](https://www.kaspersky.ru/downloads/thank-you/free-virus-removal-tool)

[Dr.Web CureIt!](http://www.freedrweb.com/cureit/?lng=en)

If this check with antivirus utilities revealed nothing, but the computer still behaves suspiciously, try to test it for adware, which can implement its advertising on any pages that you open.

## How to clean your system from Adware {#adware}

On the Internet, you can find a lot of applications that are aimed at fighting this problem. You can use any utility you like. But we strongly recommend using **[AdwareCleaner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner)** by **Malwarebytes**. This application is quite easy to use and you will be able to handle it by yourself.

After the application has been downloaded and successfully installed, you should take the following steps:

1) Start the application and click **Scan now**.

4) In some cases, you may need to **Reboot the system** after cleaning is complete.

## How to recreate shortcuts for your browsers {#shortcuts}

The simplest solution in this case is to manually delete all the shortcuts and recreate them by yourself.

**What is BetterSurf?**

BetterSurf is an advertising program that builds itself into your browser. This program puts up its ads on all websites that you visit.
