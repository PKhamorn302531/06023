There is an AdGuard app for virtually every major platform out there, and we regularly release updates for all of them. This would not be possible without beta testing and, more importantly, beta testers. Want to become one? Here's how you can do it.

## How to become a beta tester {#intro}

Our requirements are easy: use AdGuard, upgrade to the beta version when it becomes available, and report any bugs you notice. However, you will need either a [forum]--- or a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (or both) to become our beta tester, so you may want to get that out of the way first.

In any case, every single thing you need to know is gathered on a [dedicated page](https://adguard.com/en/beta.html).

If you want to skip the description part and get straight to the action, you can apply [here](https://surveys.adguard.com/beta_testing_program/form.html). Your application will be reviewed within 1-3 working days, and you'll get a reply via email.

## How to report a bug {#report-a-bug}

If you spotted a bug or just want to share your suggestion, let us know in any of the possible ways:

* Go to [forum.adguard.com]--- and post there a new thread (or find an existing one) in the beta forum [category]---. Make sure to read [forum rules]---;

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/) and find a suitable repository. Create a new issue there and describe the bug/feature request in detail.

The above two methods are the most preferred, but you can use others if necessary:

* Find us on various social media platforms, like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AdguardEn/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/), etc. However, this is not the most convenient way to discuss technical matters.

* Email our support team from the Support tab in the app or write directly to [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com).

## How to activate a beta license key on iOS {#ios}

If you have already received a beta key and it is listed in your [AdGuard account](https://auth.adguard.com/login.html), go to the app, open the license section, tap *Get Premium*, and enter the credentials from your account. After that, the premium features will become available.

### What else?

There is not much more to add. You don't have to go out of your way to find bugs. You can continue using AdGuard as usual. However, if you encounter a bug, please report it. Of course, we appreciate any additional effort and/or extra forum activity, etc.

You will receive our newsletter, keeping you informed of the latest changes in beta versions (in case you missed them) and other news. You can unsubscribe from it at any time.
