## How to activate a license

To activate your license, go to the *License* section of your AdGuard product and find the *Log in* field or *Activate* button. Use the email and password of your AdGuard account to log in. If you don't have an account yet, you will be offered to create one.

> Note: To activate a license via AdGuard account, you need to have a valid license with at least one open slot there. If your license is already used on a maximum number of devices, you can [upgrade it](#how-to-upgrade-a-license) or [transfer it from one device to another](#how-to-transfer-a-license-to-another-device).

Alternatively, you can use a [license key](../what-is#license-key) to activate the license.

## How to transfer a license to another device

The license key can be activated on a [limited number of devices](../what-is#devices). If the key has already been used on the maximum allowed number of devices, you need to unbind a device from your account. You can do that in three ways:
* by clicking the *Reset license* button (applies to desktop apps),
* by logging out of your account in an AdGuard product,
* by clicking the cross icon next to a device in your AdGuard account.

After you have unbound the number of devices you need, you can log in to your AdGuard account on new devices. The license will be bound to them.

## How to upgrade a license

To make it more convenient to use your AdGuard products, you can upgrade your license.

1. To increase the functionality of your AdGuard products, you can **upgrade your free or trial license to the full version**.
2. To extend the number of devices, you can **upgrade your AdGuard Ad Blocker Personal license to Family**.
3. You can also **upgrade your subscription to a Lifetime license**.

You can upgrade your license by:
* purchasing another license on the official websites of AdGuard products,
* clicking the *Upgrade* button in your AdGuard account.

## How to cancel a subscription

The subscription can be canceled in your AdGuard account. To cancel your subscription, click the card or the cross icon next to it and select *Unsubscribe*. The canceled subscription will be valid until its expiry date.

> Subscriptions purchased on the App Store can be managed in the App Store account or in the device's settings.
