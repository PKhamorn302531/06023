Filters are sets of rules in text format used by AdGuard apps and programs to filter out advertising and privacy-threatening content such as banners, pop-ups, or trackers. Filters contain lists of rules based on their purpose. Language filters include rules for corresponding language segments of the Internet (e.g., German filter). Task-based filters group rules that fulfil a specific task, such as Social media filter or Tracking Protection filter. Enabling or disabling a filter makes it easier to work with the entire list of rules at once.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters":{"id":"general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters","title":"How to create your own ad filters","description":"A filter is a set of filtering rules applied to specific content, such as banners or pop-ups.
